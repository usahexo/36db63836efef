        <h1 id="The-Best-Poker-Hands-to-Fold"><a href="#The-Best-Poker-Hands-to-Fold" class="headerlink" title="The Best Poker Hands to Fold"></a>The Best Poker Hands to Fold</h1><p>There are specific hands in poker that are better to fold than to play. In some cases, it’s better to fold even if you have a good hand. It’s important to know which hands to fold so that you can conserve your chips and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>The best hands to fold are typically those that are weak, such as two pairs or a high card. If you don’t have anything close to a pair, then it’s best to fold your hand. Another great time to fold is when the odds are against you and you’re not likely to win.</p>
<p>Knowing when to fold can be the difference between winning and losing at poker. If you’re not confident in your hand, then it’s always best to fold and save your chips for another round.</p>
<h1 id="6-Common-Poker-Hands-You-Should-Fold"><a href="#6-Common-Poker-Hands-You-Should-Fold" class="headerlink" title="6 Common Poker Hands You Should Fold"></a>6 Common Poker Hands You Should Fold</h1><p>In any form of poker, there are certain hands that you should just fold and not play. Here are six of the most common hands to fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low pairs (2s – 5s)</li>
</ol>
<p>Low pairs are generally not worth playing, as the odds of making a good hand are low. If you’re looking to make a simple pair, you’re better off waiting for a card that will give you a higher pair.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>High pairs (aces and kings)</li>
</ol>
<p>Pairs of aces or kings are also not worth playing, as they can easily be beaten by another player holding a better pair. There’s no point in risking your chips with such a low chance of winning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>A-K suited</li>
</ol>
<p>While an ace-king suited is not the worst hand to have, it’s still not a great hand. The reason? Suited cards tend to play better when matched with other suited cards on the table, and there are usually few (if any) other suited cards at the table when you hold this hand. So unless you can see the flop for free, it’s usually best to fold this hand.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>4-6 offsuit</li>
</ol>
<p>This is another weak hand that is generally not worth playing. Offsuit cards are ones that are not matched in rank (e.g., an ace and two clubs), and these hands tend to fare poorly against other hands at the table. Unless you hit something big on the flop, it’s usually best to fold this hand and wait for something better.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Two high cards (10-J)</li>
</ol>
<p>Similar to high pairs, two high cards (10-J) don’t offer a lot of chances of winning against other players at the table. You’re better off folding this hand and waiting for something better to come along.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Poker-Hands-to-Fold-and-When"><a href="#Which-Poker-Hands-to-Fold-and-When" class="headerlink" title="Which Poker Hands to Fold - and When"></a>Which Poker Hands to Fold - and When</h1><p>If you are new to poker, or are just starting to play more seriously, then one of the most important things you need to learn is when to fold a hand. There are certain pockets hands that you should always fold, no matter what, and there are other hands which can be played in a number of different ways, depending on the situation. In this article we take a look at which poker hands to fold - and when.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to remember is that you should never play any pocket pairs below 2s. These hands will almost always lose money in the long run, so it is best to just fold them and save your chips for bigger and better hands.</p>
<p>Another hand you should always fold is A-2 offsuit. This hand has very little chance of winning, especially against any decent opponent. You are much better off saving your chips for a hand with a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when deciding whether to fold a hand is the strength of your opponent’s hand. If they have a big pair or three of a kind then it is usually best to fold, regardless of the cards you hold. However, if your opponent only has two high cards then you may be able to call or even raise with your weaker hand.</p>
<p>The situation you find yourself in also plays a big role in determining whether or not to fold a hand. If there are lots of players still in the pot then it may be worth sticking with your weaker hand and see how the flop turns out. However, if there are only one or two players left in the pot then it may be wiser to fold and save your chips for another time.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that folding is an essential part of poker and you need to know when to do it in order to be successful at the game. By following the tips outlined in this article you can improve your chances of winning by folding the right hands at the right time.</p>
<h1 id="3-Odd-but-Good-Poker-Hands-to-Fold"><a href="#3-Odd-but-Good-Poker-Hands-to-Fold" class="headerlink" title="3 Odd but Good Poker Hands to Fold"></a>3 Odd but Good Poker Hands to Fold</h1><p>Just because a poker hand is considered “odd” doesn’t mean it’s a bad hand to play. In fact, there are times when folding an odd hand can be the best decision you make during a poker game.</p>
<p>Here are three of the most unusual but good hands to fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ace-King offsuit</li>
</ol>
<p>This hand is considered very weak and is often referred to as a “sucker” hand. Playing Ace-King offsuit in most cases will only lead to a loss of chips.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Two pair</li>
</ol>
<p>While having two pair can be a strong hand, it’s usually not worth risking your chips by playing it against another player who may have a full house or four of a kind. It’s always better to fold and wait for a better opportunity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Three of a kind</li>
</ol>
<p>A three of a kind can be a very powerful hand, but there are times when it’s best to fold this hand and wait for something better. For example, if you’re playing against someone who has a higher three of a kind, folding may be your best option.</p>
<h1 id="When-to-fold-in-poker-Which-hands-to-ditch"><a href="#When-to-fold-in-poker-Which-hands-to-ditch" class="headerlink" title="When to fold in poker: Which hands to ditch"></a>When to fold in poker: Which hands to ditch</h1><p>While poker is a game of strategy and calculated risk, there are times when folding is the best decision. Knowing when to fold your hand can mean the difference between winning and losing money.</p>
<p>In general, you should fold any hand that is not a strong starting hand. This means ditching hands like 2-4 offsuit, 3-5 offsuit, or 7-8 offsuit. These hands simply do not have enough potential to make a good hand, so folding is the best option.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other factors to consider when deciding whether or not to fold. For example, if you are playing in a tournament and have very few chips left, you may want to fold any hand that does not have a high chance of winning. This is because risking your last few chips on a weak hand is not usually worth it.</p>
<p>In addition, you should fold if you think your opponents have a stronger hand than you do. If you are playing against opponents who are more experienced than you are, they may be able to read your cards and make better decisions based on that information. In this case, folding may be your best option.</p>
<p>Overall, folding should be one of your main strategies in poker. By knowing when to fold, you can save yourself from losing money on bad hands.</p>
