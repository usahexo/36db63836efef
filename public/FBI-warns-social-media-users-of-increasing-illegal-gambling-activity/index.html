In a statement, the FBI said that it has received numerous complaints from victims of online gambling schemes. The schemes typically involve the use of third-party payment processors to collect money from victims’ bank accounts and then transfer it to the perpetrator’s bank account.</p>
<p>The FBI has advised social media users to be vigilant when engaging in online transactions and to be aware of the warning signs of illegal gambling schemes, which include unsolicited offers to gamble or requests for financial assistance to fund gambling activities.</p>
<p>Victims of illegal gambling schemes may file a complaint with the FBI at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.ic3.gov/">www.IC3.gov</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Facebook-and-Myspace-users-warned-of-online-gambling-scams"><a href="#Facebook-and-Myspace-users-warned-of-online-gambling-scams" class="headerlink" title="Facebook and Myspace users warned of online gambling scams"></a>Facebook and Myspace users warned of online gambling scams</h1><p>As social media platforms Facebook and Myspace continue to grow in popularity, so do the number of online gambling scams targeting users of these sites.</p>
<p>The scams typically involve users being invited to join a gaming site where they can win large sums of money. The site may even look legitimate, with professional design and branding. However, after submitting personal information and choosing a username and password, users realize they have been scammed when they are unable to withdraw any money from the site.</p>
<p>To avoid being scammed, always research any online gaming site before signing up. Look for reviews from other users and check that the site is legitimate by checking its accreditation on a website like GambleSafe.com. Never give away your personal information unless you are confident that the gaming site is trustworthy.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-to-help-protect-yourself-from-illegal-gambling-on-social-media"><a href="#Tips-to-help-protect-yourself-from-illegal-gambling-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="Tips to help protect yourself from illegal gambling on social media"></a>Tips to help protect yourself from illegal gambling on social media</h1><p>In recent years, online gambling has become increasingly popular, with people of all ages taking part in various forms of wagering. While many online casinos are perfectly legitimate and safe to use, there are also a number of dodgy operations that can leave unsuspecting gamblers out of pocket. To protect yourself from falling prey to illegal gambling on social media, follow these simple tips.</p>
<p>#1 Do your research</p>
<p>Before signing up for any online gambling service, be sure to do your research first. Read reviews from trusted sources and find out as much as you can about the casino or betting site in question. This will help you to avoid any illegitimate or unsafe operations.</p>
<p>#2 Use a credit card</p>
<p>When making any transactions with an online casino, always use a credit card rather than a debit card. This will offer you some protection if things go wrong and you end up losing money to an illegitimate site. As well as this, make sure to keep track of your credit card statements so that you can quickly identify any fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>#3 Only gamble with money you can afford to lose</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when gambling online is that you should never gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. This is because, no matter how reputable the casino may be, there is always the risk of losing your money. By gambling with only money you can afford to lose, you minimise this risk and ensure that you don’t end up in financial trouble if things go wrong.</p>
<p>#4 Stick to reputable casinos</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, not all online casinos are created equal – some are legitimate while others are scams. To protect yourself from being scammed, it’s important to stick to reputable casinos only. These casinos have been verified as safe and trustworthy by independent review sites.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-be-a-victim-How-to-spot-and-report-illegal-gambling-on-social-media"><a href="#Don’t-be-a-victim-How-to-spot-and-report-illegal-gambling-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="Don’t be a victim: How to spot and report illegal gambling on social media"></a>Don’t be a victim: How to spot and report illegal gambling on social media</h1><p>Around the world, millions of people participate in illegal gambling. In the United States, it is estimated that around $150 billion is gambled illegally each year. This number is only growing as online and social media gambling becomes more popular. For those who don’t know, illegal gambling is defined as any gambling that is not licensed or regulated by the government. This includes gambling that takes place on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p>
<p>In most cases, illegal gambling is not prosecuted. However, this does not mean that you cannot be a victim of this type of crime. There are a few things that you can do to stay safe and protect yourself from illegal gambling on social media:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be aware of the signs: One of the best ways to protect yourself from illegal gambling on social media is to be aware of the signs. Some of the common signs include:</li>
</ol>
<p>-Posts or ads for online or social media gambling<br>-Requests to send money for betting or gambling purposes<br>-Links to unofficial or unlicensed betting sites<br>-Posts about winning big sums of money through gambling</p>
<p>If you see any of these signs, it is important to report them to the authorities.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Stay away from unlicensed betting sites: Another key way to stay safe from illegal gambling on social media is to stay away from unlicensed betting sites. These sites are often scam sites that will steal your money. Instead, only use certified and licensed betting sites. These sites are protected by law and are much less likely to scam you out of your money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report any suspicious activity: If you see any suspicious activity related to illegal gambling on social media, be sure to report it to the authorities. This includes posts about winning big sums of money through gambling, requests to send money for betting or gambling purposes, and links to unofficial or unlicensed betting sites. By reporting this activity, you can help keep others safe and protect yourself from becoming a victim of crime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Illegitimate-casinos-taking-advantage-of-social-media-users"><a href="#Illegitimate-casinos-taking-advantage-of-social-media-users" class="headerlink" title="Illegitimate casinos taking advantage of social media users"></a>Illegitimate casinos taking advantage of social media users</h1><p>Casinos that are not legitimate often take advantage of social media users. They create fake profiles and pages to lure people in with promises of free money or other incentives. Once the user has clicked through and provided personal information, such as their address, the casino will spam them with marketing materials or even harass them through direct messages.</p>
<p>The goal of these illegitimate casinos is to make as much money as possible before the user realizes they have been scammed. By using social media platforms, these casinos can easily target a large number of people at once. In order to avoid being taken advantage of, it is important to do your research and only trust verified accounts.</p>
<p>If you are ever asked to provide personal information such as your address, be very careful. Casinos that are legitimate will never ask for this kind of information upfront. If you have any doubts, contact the casino directly to ask about their legitimacy.</p>
