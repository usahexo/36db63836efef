<p>Their initial bets of $100 each had resulted in them losing all of their money – fast. But as they watched the other players happily raking in their profits, they refused to give up.</p>
<p>They decided to double down on their next bet.</p>
<p>This time around, they put down $200 each and miraculously managed to win back all of their money, and then some!</p>
<p>What is Double Down?</p>
<p>Double down is a blackjack term that describes when a player increases their bet after seeing their first two cards. By doubling down, you are basically saying that you believe your hand has the potential to beat the dealer’s hand.</p>
<p>Most casinos will allow you to double down on any two cards, but there are usually limits as to how much you can bet. In most cases, your total bet cannot exceed half of your original bet. For example, if you originally bet $50, your maximum doubledown bet would be $25.</p>
<p>Reasons to Double Down</p>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to consider doubling down on your next blackjack hand:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You have a good hand – If you have a strong hand such as an Ace and King (pairs), then doubling down may be the right move. This allows you to risk a smaller amount of money while trying to increase your profits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The dealer is weak – If the dealer has low cards showing (2 through 6), they may be more likely to bust. This gives you an advantage and makes it a good time to double down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have plenty of chips left – When playing with live dealers, it’s important not to run out of chips before the end of the game! If you still have plenty of chips left, then it may be worth doubling down in order to try and win even more money.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Playing without its star point guard Keith Langford, who was out with an ankle injury, UNICS got a big game from Marcus Williams and was led by his 23 points.</p>
<p>CSKA had a chance to tie the game up in the closing seconds, but Nick Calathes’s three-point attempt rimmed out and UNICS held on for the win.</p>
<p>Kazan will now move on to face FC Barcelona in the semifinals.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Basketball-Champions-Ready-to-Double-Down-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Russian-Basketball-Champions-Ready-to-Double-Down-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Russian Basketball Champions Ready to Double Down in Blackjack"></a>Russian Basketball Champions Ready to Double Down in Blackjack</h1><p>The Russian team who won the European Basketball Championship in 2015 is looking to make a repeat performance this year. They’ve come into the tournament as one of the favorites, and they’re looking to take down any opponent who gets in their way.</p>
<p>This year’s roster is stacked with some of the best players in the world. Captain Andrey Vorontsevich is one of the top Russian players in the NBA, and he’ll be leading the team on the court. Other notable players include Sergio Rodriguez, Nikita Kurbanov, and Sergey Karasev.</p>
<p> Coach Sergey Dyachenko has been preparing his team for months, and they’re ready to take on anyone who stands in their way. With their skills and teamwork, they’re sure to bring home another championship title.</p>
<p>Russia is scheduled to play against Slovenia on September 17th, so make sure to tune in and see their amazing skills in action!</p>
<h1 id="UNICS-Kazan-Shows-Championship-Form-with-Clever-Blackjack-Plays"><a href="#UNICS-Kazan-Shows-Championship-Form-with-Clever-Blackjack-Plays" class="headerlink" title="UNICS Kazan Shows Championship Form with Clever Blackjack Plays"></a>UNICS Kazan Shows Championship Form with Clever Blackjack Plays</h1><p>The UNICS Kazan men’s basketball team demonstrated championship form on September 14, 2018 in a clever blackjack play against Avtodor Saratov. Led by top scorer Evgeniy Voronov with 27 points, UNICS overcame an inferior scoring output in the first half to win 92-78.</p>
<p>It was Voronov who came up with the key sequence of the game midway through the fourth quarter. Trailing by four points, he hit a three-pointer and then converted a four-point play after being fouled on a driving layup. This gave UNICS the lead for good at 79-75.</p>
<p>UNICS head coach Georgi Samsonidze was pleased with his team’s effort. “We knew that it would be a very tough game, and our players responded well to adversity,” he said.</p>
<p>Evgeniy Voronov was named the Most Valuable Player of the game. He acknowledged that things had not gone as well as he would have liked in the first half, but was happy with how his team had battled back to win. “We played better in the second half and managed to get the victory,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="When-to-Double-Down-in-Blackjack-Lessons-from-Russian-Champions"><a href="#When-to-Double-Down-in-Blackjack-Lessons-from-Russian-Champions" class="headerlink" title="When to Double Down in Blackjack: Lessons from Russian Champions"></a>When to Double Down in Blackjack: Lessons from Russian Champions</h1><p>In life, there are always important decisions to make. What career should you pursue? Who should you marry? How much money should you gamble in a casino?</p>
<p>All difficult questions with no easy answers.</p>
<p>But one question that is less ambiguous is whether or not you should double down in blackjack. The answer to this is usually a resounding yes - but only if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you need to assess the size of your bankroll and the table limits. If you only have a small amount of money to gamble with, then it’s probably not worth doubling down on any hands. You’ll want to play it safe and hope for the best.</p>
<p>But if you’re playing at a high limit table and feel confident about your ability to win, then doubling down can be a great way to increase your profits. Just make sure that the odds are in your favour first.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is what type of hand you have. If you have an Ace and a 10, for example, it’s usually wise to double down - especially if there are other low cards on the table. This gives you a good chance of winning the hand (especially if the dealer has a low card as well).</p>
<p>But if you have, say, an Ace and a 2, then it might be wiser to just hit instead of doubling down. The chances of winning aren’t as good in this case, so it’s not worth taking the risk.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that blackjack is all about making calculated risks. If the odds are in your favour, then doubling down can be a very profitable move. But if the odds are against you, then it’s best to fold and walk away from the table.</p>
