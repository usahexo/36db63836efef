        <h1 id="What-are-7bit-poker-rules"><a href="#What-are-7bit-poker-rules" class="headerlink" title="What are 7bit poker rules?"></a>What are 7bit poker rules?</h1><p>There are a few variations of 7bit poker, but the most common version is a draw poker game where the player is dealt seven cards and must use exactly two of them to make a hand. The Ace is high and the two is low.</p>
<p>7bit poker can be played with any number of players, but is typically best with three to five. A regular 52-card deck is used, with the jokers removed. The dealer deals seven cards to each player, face down. The rest of the cards are placed in the middle of the table, face down, to form a draw pile. </p>
<p>The player to the dealer’s left starts the betting and must either bet or fold. The betting continues clockwise around the table. Each player in turn either checks (if no bet has been made so far in that round), bets or raises (by putting in more chips than anyone else who has bet so far in that round), or folds. </p>
<p>Once all bets have been made, each player who hasn’t folded yet turns over his two cards. The best hand wins the pot. In case of a tie, the pot is split evenly between the players involved in the tie. </p>
<p>Here are the most common hands in descending order: </p>
<p>One important rule to remember is that only two cards may be used to make a hand - no discarding and drawing again!</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-poker-rules-Bolivia"><a href="#What-are-the-poker-rules-Bolivia" class="headerlink" title="What are the poker rules Bolivia?"></a>What are the poker rules Bolivia?</h1><p>The poker rules in Bolivia may be different than in other countries, so it is important to know what the specific rules are before playing. There are a few variations of poker that are played in Bolivia, so it is important to understand which type of game is being played. </p>
<p>One variation of poker that is popular in Bolivia is called “Ruleta”. In this game, players are dealt two cards face down and five cards are placed face up in the centre of the table. The player must use two of their face down cards and three of the face up cards to make a poker hand. The highest ranking hand is a royal flush, followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and two pair. If no player has any of these hands, then the player with the highest ranking card wins. </p>
<p>Another popular variation of poker in Bolivia is called “Póquer Puro”. In this game, all players are dealt five cards face down. A player must use two cards from their hand to make a poker hand. The rank of hands is the same as in Ruleta. The first player to discard all of their cards wins the game. </p>
<p>As with most games, there are some basic rules that apply when playing poker in Bolivia. All players must place an ante into the pot before each hand is dealt. In addition, players must also place a bet (equal to twice the amount of the ante) on whether they believe they have the best hand or not at the end of the hand. If a player folds, they forfeit their bet but do not lose their ante. If all players but one fold, that player automatically wins even if they do not have the best hand. The winner takes the pot and any bets that were made during the course of the hand</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-Seven-Card-Stud-Poker"><a href="#What-is-a-Seven-Card-Stud-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What is a Seven Card Stud Poker?"></a>What is a Seven Card Stud Poker?</h1><p>Seven Card Stud Poker is one of the most popular poker variants. The game is played with a deck of 52 cards and up to eight players can participate in the game. each player gets seven cards and the aim of the game is to make the best possible five-card poker hand.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play"><a href="#How-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="How to Play"></a>How to Play</h1><p>To begin, all players must ante up. The dealer then distributes seven cards face down to each player clockwise. One card is then dealt face up in the middle of the table - this is known as the “up card”. The player with the lowest up card starts the action and has three options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To open - This means that they place a bet equal to twice the big blind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To fold - This means that they forfeit their hand and do not participate in any further rounds of betting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To call - This means that they match the amount of the opening bet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next card is turned over (the turn card), followed by another round of betting, this time starting with the player who has the second lowest up card. Once again, players have three options: to open, fold or call. A fourth street card is then turned over (the river card) and a final round of betting takes place, beginning with the player who has the highest up card. The best five-card poker hand wins!</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-Texas-Hold’em-Poker"><a href="#What-is-a-Texas-Hold’em-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What is a Texas Hold’em Poker?"></a>What is a Texas Hold’em Poker?</h1><p>Texas hold’em is the most popular variant of poker and is played by millions of people around the world. The game is a type of community card poker, which means that players share some of the cards dealt face-up in the middle of the table. The objective of Texas hold’em is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of the two hole cards and five shared community cards.</p>
<p>As with all variants of poker, the aim is to make the best hand possible using two downcards and five upcards. In Texas hold’em, these are called your hole cards and the board, respectively. The rank of hands in Texas hold’em is identical to regular poker, with one exception: a straight flush beats a four of a kind. In addition to this, as in all variants of poker, there are also side pots which can be won by players who are not holding the best hand.</p>
<p>The game begins with each player being given two cards face down - these are your hole cards. Then, five community cards are placed face up on the table - these are called the board. The first three rounds of betting take place, beginning with the player to the left of the dealer and continuing clockwise around the table. After this, three more community cards are placed on the table (the turn), followed by another round of betting. Finally, when all betting has finished, the last community card (the river) is placed on the table and a final round of betting takes place.</p>
<p>The player who ends up with the best hand after all rounds of betting wins not only that particular hand but also any side pots which may have been created during play.</p>
