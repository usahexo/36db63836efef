Protestant denomination in the Federated States of Micronesia. It was founded on September 3, 1983, as the result of a merger between the Evangelical Church in the Federated States of Micronesia and the United Pentecostal Church in the Federated States of Micronesia. The UCCM has about 4,000 members spread across 15 churches.\n\n\n#  What are the beliefs of the United Christian Church Micronesia?\n\nThe United Christian Church Micronesia believes in one God who created the world and all that exists in it. They also believe in the Bible as the authoritative source of religious teachings. The church teaches that Jesus is the only way to receive salvation and eternal life.\n\n#  How does the United Christian Church Micronesia differ from other Christian Churches?\n\nThe United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM) is a Protestant denomination that was founded in 1989. It is the only Christian church in Micronesia, which consists of more than 600 islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean. The UCCM has about 15,000 baptized members and about 30,000 associate members.\n\nThe UCCM differs from other Christian churches in a few ways:\n\n- The UCCM emphasizes the importance of family and community. They believe that these are essential for healthy spiritual growth.\n\n- The UCCM believes that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not through good works.\n\n- The UCCM rejects the doctrine of predestination, which teaches that some people are predestined to be saved while others are predestined to be damned.\n\n- The UCCM opposes abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n#  What is the history of the United Christian Church Micronesia?\n\nThe United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM) is a Protestant denomination that was founded in 1966. It is the largest Protestant church in the Federated States of Micronesia, with about 8,000 members. The UCCM has its roots in the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), which began work in the region in the late 19th century.\n\nThe first Protestant missionaries arrived in the Caroline Islands (now part of the Federated States of Micronesia) in 1852. They were from the ABCFM, a Protestant missionary society based in the United States. Over the next few decades, other Protestant denominations - including the Methodist Episcopal Church, South - also began working in the region.\n\nIn 1966, a group of local pastors and lay leaders met to discuss forming a new national church body. The goal was to better unite the various Protestant denominations present in Micronesia and to more effectively minister to local people. In May 1967, representatives from nine Protestant churches gathered in Palikir, Pohnpei, to formally establish the United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM).\n\nThe UCCM has grown steadily over the years and today has congregations on many of the islands in Micronesia. It is affiliated with both the World Council of Churches and the Pacific Conference of Churches.\n\n#  Who are the leaders of the United Christian Church Micronesia?\n\nThe leadership of the United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM) is vested in the Board of Elders, which is elected by members of the church. The current Board of Elders is as follows:\n\nPresident: Rev. Dr. Kasey Salel\nVice President: Elder Fanny Kenny\nSecretary: Elder Tito Kenny  Treasurer: Elder Tony Panei\nAssistant Secretary/Treasurer: Elder Tatiana Panei\nSpiritual Leader: Rev.

It is the only Christian church in Micronesia, which consists of more than 600 islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean. The UCCM has about 15,000 baptized members and about 30,000 associate members.\n\nThe UCCM differs from other Christian churches in a few ways:\n\n- The UCCM emphasizes the importance of family and community. They believe that these are essential for healthy spiritual growth.\n\n- The UCCM believes that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not through good works.\n\n- The UCCM rejects the doctrine of predestination, which teaches that some people are predestined to be saved while others are predestined to be damned.\n\n- The UCCM opposes abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n#  What is the history of the United Christian Church Micronesia?\n\nThe United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM) is a Protestant denomination that was founded in 1966. It is the largest Protestant church in the Federated States of Micronesia, with about 8,000 members. The UCCM has its roots in the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), which began work in the region in the late 19th century.\n\nThe first Protestant missionaries arrived in the Caroline Islands (now part of the Federated States of Micronesia) in 1852. They were from the ABCFM, a Protestant missionary society based in the United States. Over the next few decades, other Protestant denominations - including the Methodist Episcopal Church, South - also began working in the region.\n\nIn 1966, a group of local pastors and lay leaders met to discuss forming a new national church body. The goal was to better unite the various Protestant denominations present in Micronesia and to more effectively minister to local people. In May 1967, representatives from nine Protestant churches gathered in Palikir, Pohnpei, to formally establish the United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM).\n\nThe UCCM has grown steadily over the years and today has congregations on many of the islands in Micronesia. It is affiliated with both the World Council of Churches and the Pacific Conference of Churches.\n\n#  Who are the leaders of the United Christian Church Micronesia?\n\nThe leadership of the United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM) is vested in the Board of Elders, which is elected by members of the church.
