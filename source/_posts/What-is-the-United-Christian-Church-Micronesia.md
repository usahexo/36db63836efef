#  What is the history of the United Christian Church Micronesia?

The United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM) is a Protestant denomination that was founded in 1966. It is the largest Protestant church in the Federated States of Micronesia, with about 8,000 members. The UCCM has its roots in the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), which began work in the region in the late 19th century.

The first Protestant missionaries arrived in the Caroline Islands (now part of the Federated States of Micronesia) in 1852. They were from the ABCFM, a Protestant missionary society based in the United States. Over the next few decades, other Protestant denominations - including the Methodist Episcopal Church, South - also began working in the region.

In 1966, a group of local pastors and lay leaders met to discuss forming a new national church body. The goal was to better unite the various Protestant denominations present in Micronesia and to more effectively minister to local people. In May 1967, representatives from nine Protestant churches gathered in Palikir, Pohnpei, to formally establish the United Christian Church Micronesia (UCCM).

The UCCM has grown steadily over the years and today has congregations on many of the islands in Micronesia. It is affiliated with both the World Council of Churches and the Pacific Conference of Churches.
