#  Unics betting preview: Can Kazan upset Barcelona on the road? 

In the Unics betting preview for their Round of 16 matchup against Barcelona, we take a look at whether Unics can pull off the upset on the road.

Unics comes into this matchup as heavy underdogs according to the odds, but they have been playing some very good basketball of late. They have won six of their last seven games, and their only loss in that span came against CSKA Moscow on the road.

Barcelona also comes into this matchup playing well, with five wins in their last six games. However, two of those wins came against weaker teams in Strasbourg and Telenet Ostend, while their only loss in that span came against Real Madrid.

Based on these records and matchups, it looks like Barcelona is the heavy favorite to win this series. However, Unics has shown that they can compete with anyone in Europe, so they cannot be counted out quite yet. If they can continue to play well and get some big performances from players like Keith Langford and Bryant Dunston, they may have a chance to pull off the upset on the road.

#  Expert picks for Unics-Barcelona betting: Who will come out on top? 

The 32nd round of the Spanish ACB League will take place on Monday night, with Unics Kazan travelling to Barcelona to take on FC Barcelona. The home side are clear favourites, but Unics will not be easy opponents, and so there are several potential outcomes for this game. 

Here we take a look at the expert opinion of who will come out on top in this one, as well as what betting odds are currently available.

According to Eurohoops.net, Barcelona are big favourites to win this game, with a 62% chance of victory. Unics are given a 38% chance of winning, which seems about fair when considering how evenly matched these two teams are. 

Looking at the odds from various bookmakers, we can see that Barcelona are around 1.22 favourites to win, while Unics are around 5.00 underdogs. This would suggest that there is some value in betting on Unics to upset the odds and pull off an away victory here. 

Of course, it is worth noting that these odds may change as the game approaches, so it is always worth checking the latest betting markets before placing any bets.

#  How to make money on Unics' clash with Barcelona in the Euroleague Playoffs 

In the final game of the first round of the playoffs in the Euroleague, Unics Kazan faced Barcelona. The Spanish team had an advantage in head-to-head matches during the regular season, and they were expected to win this game. However, Unics came back from 14 points behind in the fourth quarter to get a 95-91 victory and improve their chances to reach the next stage of the Euroleague.

The match was very intense from the beginning. Both teams were trying to impose their style of play, but Barcelona was having more success early on. They took a nine-point lead in the second quarter, and it looked like they would cruise to victory. However, Unics refused to give up. They made a comeback in the third quarter and even took the lead early in the fourth quarter.

It was really anybody's game at that point, and both teams kept exchanging baskets. Finally, with less than two minutes left in the game, Unics managed to create some distance between them and Barcelona thanks to some clutch shots by Malcolm Delaney. That proved to be enough for them to get the win and move on to the next round of the Euroleague playoffs.

Making money on basketball games can be difficult, but there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of winning some bets. First of all, make sure that you are well-informed about both teams involved in the game. Know their strengths and weaknesses, as well as recent trends. Additionally, try not to place too many bets on any one game. This will help you spread your risks out and ensure that you don’t lose too much money if one bet doesn’t go your way. Finally, make sure you are using reputable sports betting websites that offer good odds and plenty of betting options.
