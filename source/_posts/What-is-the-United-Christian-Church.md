#  What do they believe?

There is no single answer to this question, as atheism is a complex and diverse philosophy. However, there are some core beliefs that atheists may share.

First and foremost, atheists generally do not believe in the existence of gods or other supernatural entities. This disbelief is the root of the word "atheist" - from the Ancient Greek atheos, meaning "without gods".

Atheists also generally do not believe in any sort of afterlife or divine retribution. Instead, they believe that this life is all we have, and that our actions here in this world are what determine our fate.

Finally, atheists often hold that there is no inherent meaning or purpose to life, apart from what we create for ourselves. This can lead to a sense of nihilism or despair for some, but others find comfort in the idea that life is what we make it and that we have the power to shape our own destiny.
