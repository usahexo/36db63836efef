#  What is the significance of 7bit in SSC Napoli? 

The number 7 has always been considered a lucky number. It is said to bring good luck and success. This is why the sports club SSC Napoli has chosen this number as their logo. 

The significance of the number 7bit in SSC Napoli lies in the fact that it is the sum of 2 and 5, which are also considered lucky numbers. Moreover, when these two numbers are put together, they form the shape of a perfect pyramid. This is why the number 7bit is so revered by the club’s fans and players alike. 

There have been many notable players who have worn the number 7 shirt for SSC Napoli over the years. Some of these players include Diego Maradona, Gianfranco Zola, and Edinson Cavani. Maradona is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time, and he helped lead SSC Napoli to numerous successes during his time with the club. Cavani too is a very successful player, having won several trophies with both SSC Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain. 

The number 7 shirt is therefore seen as a symbol of good luck and success for SSC Napoli. The club’s fans hope that their team can continue to achieve great things while wearing this iconic number on their shirts.

#  How did SSC Napoli perform in the 2016/17 season? 

The 2016/17 season was a great one for SSC Napoli. They managed to finish in third place in Serie A, which was a fantastic result.

It was especially impressive given that they were up against some very tough competition, including the likes of AS Roma, Juventus and Inter Milan.

Napoli’s progress under coach Maurizio Sarri has been remarkable and they will be looking to build on their success next season. 

Here is a look at how they fared in the 2016/17 season.

Serie A: 
Napoli finished the season in third place with 82 points. This was a great achievement, especially as they were up against some very strong competition. 
They had a good run of form in the second half of the season, which saw them finish above teams like AS Roma and Inter Milan. 
Their only disappointment was their Champions League campaign, where they were knocked out in the group stages. 
Overall, it was a good season for Napoli and they will be looking to build on this next year.
Coppa Italia: 
Napoli reached the semi-final stage of the Coppa Italia, but were eventually knocked out by Juventus. 
This was still a good achievement though, and it showed that they are capable of competing with the best teams in Italy. 
Champions League: 
Napoli’s Champions League campaign was not a successful one as they were knocked out in the group stages. 
This was largely due to their poor performances against Benfica and Dynamo Kyiv, where they lost both matches 3-1. Europa League: 
Napoli fared much better in the Europa League and reached the semi-final stage before being knocked out by eventual winners Manchester United. 	This was an excellent achievement and showed that they are capable of competing with some of Europe’s top teams.

#  Who are some of the key players on the SSC Napoli squad? 

The current Napoli side is full of world-class talent, with many big-name players. Probably the most well-known is striker Arkadiusz Milik, who scored twice in the Champions League against Liverpool this season. However, he is not the only threat up front – Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon are also deadly strikers.

In midfield, Polish international Piotr Zielinski and Italy’s Marek Hamsik are both very talented players, while Kalidou Koulibaly is one of the best defenders in Europe. The team is coached by Carlo Ancelotti, who has won league titles in England, France and Germany.

Napoli have been one of the most exciting teams to watch in Europe this season, and will be hoping to go one better than their runner-up finish in Serie A last year.

#  What stadium do SSC Napoli play at? 

Stadio San Paolo is the home of SSC Napoli, one of the most successful clubs in Italy. They have won Serie A twice, and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1989. The stadium originally held 58,000 fans, but has since been renovated and now has a capacity of 60,240.

#  When was SSC Napoli founded?

The club was founded on August 12, 1926 as Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli, by the merger of two other clubs namely Internazionale Napoli and Pablo.
