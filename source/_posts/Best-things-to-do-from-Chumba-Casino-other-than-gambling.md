# 3. Gamble responsibly

Another important thing to remember is to gamble responsibly. This means setting limits on how much money you can spend and how long you are going to play for. It also means not letting gambling become a form of addiction or compulsion. If you find yourself gambling more than you intended, it is advisable to take a break from casino games altogether.
