#  Utah waitress wins $1 million jackpot in casino Tiki game

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah - A Utah waitress has hit the jackpot at a casino, winning $1 million on a Tiki game.

Stacie Everette had been playing the game for just 10 minutes when she hit the big win.

"I screamed and I jumped up and down," Everette said. "It was crazy."

Everette, who has been working as a waitress for six years to support her four children, said she plans to use the money to pay off her debts and buy a new home.

"I'm just so excited," she said. "I still can't believe it."

#  Waitress from Florida nets $500,000 in casino Tiki game

A waitress from Florida has landed a $500,000 jackpot in the casino Tiki game. The 26-year-old was playing the slots at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa when the lucky win happened.

“I couldn’t believe it,” she said in a statement. “I was so excited and just screamed out loud. I still can’t believe it.”

She plans to use the money to pay off her student loans and buy a new car.

This isn’t the first big win for Seminole gaming machines; in fact, the Florida casino has had several six-figure payouts in recent months. In November, for instance, a player hit a $1 million jackpot on a penny machine. So if you’re looking to make some serious money, there’s no better place to play than at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.

#  Massachusetts waitress takes home $250,000 from casino Tiki game

In the state of Massachusetts, a waitress has won big at a casino game. Cathy Pemberton, of Wareham, took home more than $250,000 from a Tiki game at the Twin River Casino in Lincoln. The grandmother said she had been playing slots and other games for about four hours when she hit the big payout.

“I was shaking. I couldn’t believe it,” Pemberton said of her win. She plans to use the money to help her daughter and grandson, both of whom are going through tough times. “I just feel so blessed,” she added.

This isn’t the first time that Twin River has paid out large sums of money on its Tiki game; in fact, a winner took home $1 million back in February 2017. That said, it is still an impressive win, especially given that Pemberton only put in $20 at the machine.

Casinos are always looking for new games to attract players and keep them engaged; Tiki is one such game. It is a variation on traditional slots games and involves betting on symbols that appear on three horizontal lines across the screen. If all three match, you win.

Tiki games are becoming increasingly popular with casino-goers; in fact, they now account for more than 60% of all slot machine revenue in the United States. This is in part because they offer some of the best odds for players; unlike traditional slots games, where you have to bet on every line, you can bet as little or as much as you want on Tiki games without affecting your odds of winning.

If you’re looking for a chance to hit it big at a casino, give Tiki games a try!
