#  RUNNERS UP IN TWIN RIVER POKER TOURNAMENT GET CASH PRIZE OF $1,875

The runners up in the Twin River poker tournament last weekend each walked away with a cash prize of $1,875. Players finishing in the money in this event included Randy Lew, Amir Lehavot, and Sam Stein.

Randy Lew had a particularly impressive showing, making it all the way to the final table. He ultimately finished in 7th place, taking home $7,500 in prize money. Lehavot and Stein also had deep runs, both reaching the final table before eventually bowing out in 3rd and 4th place, respectively.

The eventual winner of the tournament was Dietrich Fast, who took home a first-place prize of $27,000. This was Fast’s second victory in a major tournament this year; he also won a World Series of Poker event back in May.

With over 1,000 entrants, the Twin River poker tournament saw some of the biggest names in poker vying for a piece of the action. The final table alone featured several world champions and other top players. In the end, however, it was Fast who came out on top.
