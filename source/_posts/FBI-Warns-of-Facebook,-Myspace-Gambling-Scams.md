#  FBI Warns of Facebook, Myspace Gambling Scams
The FBI has issued a warning about a new scam that is targeting Facebook and Myspace users. 

The scam involves fake online casinos that lure people in with the promise of big payouts. But once users sign up and start playing, they realize that they can't win any money. The casinos are just a way to steal people's personal information. 

So far, there have been reports of more than $1 million in losses due to this scam. And it's likely that the number is only going to increase as more and more people become addicted to gambling. 

So how can you protect yourself from these scams? First, never give out your personal information unless you're 100% sure that the site is legitimate. And second, be very careful about the online casinos you choose to play at. Do your research first and make sure that the casino is reputable and has a good track record. 

If you're ever in doubt, it's always best to err on the side of caution and not risk losing your hard-earned money.

#  Parents Warned of Gambling Sites Popular With Teens

Many parents are unaware of the dangers of gambling websites, which are becoming increasingly popular with teenagers. These websites can be extremely addictive and can lead to serious financial problems.

One such website is "Steam", which allows users to gamble using virtual items from video games. These items can then be traded for real-world money, and some teenagers have lost thousands of dollars this way.

Another popular gambling site is "Fortnite" Battle Royale, which has become a phenomenon in recent months. The game is free to play, but players can purchase in-game items with real money. These items can then be used to gamble on the game's "Battle Pass".

Some parents may not even be aware that their children are playing these games, as they are often marketed as harmless online entertainment. But it's important for parents to be aware of the risks associated with gambling websites and to talk to their children about them.

Gambling addiction can be very harmful, both physically and financially. It's important for parents to keep an eye on their children's online activity, and to take steps to protect them from the dangers of gambling websites.

#  New Bill Looks to Crack Down on Illegal Gambling on Social Media Sites

In a move that is being praised by many as a long-awaited crackdown on illegal gambling, a new bill has been proposed in the Senate that would make it a felony to gamble on social media sites.

The proposal, which was announced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein this week, would amend the 1961 Wire Act to include all forms of gambling, including those that take place over social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Under the proposed bill, violators could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

“The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel reinterpreted the Wire Act in 2011 to apply only to sports betting, opening the door for online gambling by companies like PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker,” said Senator Grassley in a statement. “This bill would ensure that the Wire Act covers all forms of gambling without exception and provides law enforcement with the tools they need to crack down on illegal gambling operations.”

Opponents of the bill argue that it will do more harm than good, leading to less innovation in the online gambling space and costing states millions in lost tax revenue. They also maintain that the bill is redundant given that online gambling is already illegal under federal law.

However, supporters of the bill say that it is necessary to clarify the law and give law enforcement officials additional tools to fight illegal gambling.

“This bill will give law enforcement officials another tool in their arsenal as they work to shut down these illegal operations,” said Senator Feinstein.

#  FBI Investigating Use of Social Media for Illegal Gambling

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating illegal gambling on social media platforms. The investigation was sparked by a complaint filed in December 2017 by the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA).

The NFLPA’s complaint alleges that two “unnamed social media platforms” were being used to illegally gamble on NFL games. The NFLPA claims that the platforms allowed users to place bets on games and then share screenshots of the winning bets with others on the platform.

This is not the first time that social media has been used for gambling purposes. In 2016, three people plead guilty to federal charges related to illegal gambling activities conducted on Facebook. And in 2017, a number of arrests were made in connection with an illegal gambling ring that used WhatsApp to place bets.

So why is the FBI interested in investigating social media for illegal gambling?

One reason may be that it is relatively easy for authorities to track down those involved in such activities. With gambling rings that use traditional methods like bookmakers or casinos, it can be more difficult to identify everyone involved. But with social media, all bets are placed and tracked through public posts, which makes it easier for law enforcement officials to identify those involved.

Another possible reason for the FBI’s interest is the potential for large-scale money laundering operations through social media gambling sites. In traditional gambling operations, money is often laundered through shell companies or offshore accounts. But with social media, money can be laundered more easily and more discreetly because there is no physical transaction taking place. This could make it an attractive option for criminals looking to launder money illegally.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that the FBI is taking illegal gambling on social media seriously and is likely to step up its investigations in this area in the coming years.
