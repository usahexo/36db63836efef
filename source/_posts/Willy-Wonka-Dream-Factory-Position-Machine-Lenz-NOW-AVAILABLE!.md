Life is unpredictable. One day you may be planning for your future, and the next you may be gone. That's why it's important to have a plan in place for what happens to your estate after you die. A will enables you to ensure that your property and assets are distributed in accordance with your wishes.

If you don't have a will, state law will dictate how your estate is divided. This can result in assets being distributed in a way that you wouldn't want, or not being distributed at all. That's why it's important to have a will and to keep it up-to-date.

There are several things to consider when drafting a will. Here are some tips:

1. Name an executor. The executor is responsible for carrying out the terms of your will and distributing your assets accordingly. It's important to choose someone you trust who is capable of handling this responsibility.

2. Decide who will inherit your property and assets. You can choose specific individuals or entities to inherit your property, or you can use a "residuary clause" to distribute everything left over after specific individuals have been given their share.

3. Choose a guardian for minor children. If you have young children, you'll need to name a guardian who will care for them in the event of your death.

4. Make sure your will is valid in accordance with state law. Wills must meet certain requirements in order to be valid, so it's important to consult an attorney before drafting one.

5. Review and update your will regularly. Life changes, so it's important to review and update your will regularly to reflect these changes. Things that may change include your marital status, the value of your estate, and who you would like to leave property or assets to should something happen to you.

If you're ready to get started on creating your will, the best place to start is by using a template provided by an online legal document service such as LegalZoom [1]. This will help ensure that your will meets all the necessary requirements in accordance with state law.
