Despite the home side’s dominance for the majority of the match, they were unable to take the lead until the 73rd minute when Kevin Kampl scored from close range. However, 10 minutes later Celta drew level after an unfortunate own goal by Stefan Kießling.

Bayer 04 Leverkusen came out on top in a 2-1 victory over VfL Wolfsburg in spite of an admittedly poor hand.
